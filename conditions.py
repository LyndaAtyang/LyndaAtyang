#sequentially- step by step in the order they are written

#Selection/Conditional statements -takes a decision to execute
#one statement over another depending on the condition

#Iteration- executes a set of statements repeatedly until the condition is met

#CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS:

# if False:#this condition is true
